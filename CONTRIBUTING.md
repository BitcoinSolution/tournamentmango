# Issues

If you have a problem, please open a _descriptive_ issue that details the problem. Please show screenshots and provide reproduction details as necessary!

# Feature Requests

If you would like to request a feature, feel free to do so. Not all features are in scope, but the request will be addressed regardless.

# Commit Format

Always make your commits in the format of `%{type}(%{scope}): %{description}` where:

  * type is one of the following: docs, feat, fix, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, revert
  * scope is the module you are working on (tournaments, tournamentManager, etc)
  * description is what you fixed, briefly
  
If you are closing or referencing any commits, add that to the body of your message (ie, not in the description).

# Style Checking

If your code does not pass the style checking, it will not be merged.

# Unit Tests

There are currently no unit tests, but if you add them, you get brownie points!
