OpenChallenge is an open source tournament bracket and user management system. You can build an archive of players and keep track of all their scores over time (as well as their regular characters, games, and aliases).

You can also create and manage events and tournaments. An event is essentially a group of tournaments, but an event isn't necessary to create a tournament.

Currently, the bracket generator only supports single and double elimination, but free for all (and a variant) and round robin are coming soon.
